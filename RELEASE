Release a new version:
* update version number in build.gradle
* commit the change and land to master
* after build passed on master: run "Publish Maven Package" action
* after "Publish Maven Package" is success, run "Release Maven Package" action
Validate:


Trouble shooting:
* check new version is published to https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/diem/client-sdk-java
  * Note: it may take some time to be published to above url after the "Release Maven Package" action succeed
  * other place like https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.diem/client-sdk-java will take longer time to be updated
* when publish failed, login to https://oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories to check packages, manual close and release.
  * likely should drop all packages (because they only contain partial uploaded stuff), then retry the publish again.
